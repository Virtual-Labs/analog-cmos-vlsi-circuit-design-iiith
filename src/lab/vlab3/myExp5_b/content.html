            The elegant concept of “differential” signals and amplifiers was invented in the 1940s and first utilized in vacuum-tube circuits. Since then, differential circuits have found increasingly wider usage in microelectronics and serve as a robust, high-performance design paradigm in many of today’s systems. This introduction describes bipolar and MOS differential amplifiers and formulates their large-signal and small-signal properties.

	      The procedure for doing the experiments is as follows:<br/>
Step 1: Draw the schematic of the circuit topology with default values of different parameters. Please select the component and then drag and drop.<br/>
<img src="Differential.png">
Step 2: Please go through the introduction and theory, understand the basic motivation behind the topology.<br/>
Step 3: Fix your specifications and do hand calculations based on the design equations given for the circuit.<br/>
Step 4: Change the default values on the schematic based on the design calculations carried out in Step. 3.<br/>
Step  5: Press the simulation button and see the graph in a separate tab.Vary different design parameters and understand the variations in bandwidth, gain, signal swing etc.<br/>
Step  6: Varify your results to match with the target sepcifications of Step. 3.<br/>
